## An Overview From The Creator

My name is Ben Wheatley, and I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in 1998. From 2001 to 2008, I was hospitalized for mania at an average rate of almost once per year (7 times in 8 years)—including one month-long hospitalization. In response, I developed a mood tracking system from scratch that was designed to help me monitor my condition and promote self-regulation. I've used the system three times a day for many years, significantly reducing both my emergency room visits and my rate of psychiatric hospitalization.

From 2008 to 2013, I was hospitalized only once every three years. As of today, I have been hospitalized just once in the past 10 years and not at all in the last seven years.

The mood tracking system I developed is designed to flash red whenever I begin to experience mania. The system poses 10 questions (e.g., “Are you feeling optimistic about the future?”) and assesses mood on a 100-point scale (anything above 50 signifies an up mood, anything below 50 indicates a down mood). My highest score was 85, the day my son was born. However, I wasn't manic that day. Therefore, I introduced a second metric (on a scale of 0 to 10) to measure my mania level. On this scale, scores between 0 and 5 are a green light (not manic), 5 to 7 signal caution (yellow light), and 7 to 10 trigger the red flashing light.

I found that this early warning system empowers me to take steps to counteract the onset of mania. For instance, I learned that eating, exercise, and talking to people help. I collaborated with my therapist to establish a plan: if I scored 8 or higher and the system was flashing red, I would take an anti-psychotic pill as needed. These measures helped me avoid hospitalization.

To generate the mania score, I ask five additional questions (e.g., hours of sleep and number of “Big Ideas”). Another factor is “outside warnings” (e.g., if a family member or friend expresses concern about my mental health). I swiftly realized the significance of this factor, warranting a heavier weight. The remaining two questions are about “caught manic thoughts” and “believed manic thoughts.” I may have thoughts like people reading my emails, but if I recognize it as manic thinking, it's “caught.” If I genuinely believe it's happening, it's a “believed” manic thought.

Through trial and error, I established weights for each of these queries. Over time, I refined these weights until the scores provided a highly accurate representation of my manic state. If the system indicates I am at 6.8 with a yellow label, that accurately represents my condition at that moment.

However, it wasn't just the output that proved helpful; the process of inputting the data was also beneficial. The system forced me to monitor my own thought processes. I became acutely aware of my own manic thinking and took steps to counteract it. This process of self-regulation allowed me to reduce the frequency of manic episodes, subsequently decreasing the number of emergency room visits and psychiatric hospitalizations I had to endure (at great expense to myself and the healthcare system).

## On Existing Mood Tracking Systems

There is no shortage of mood tracking systems available on the market today. Apple’s App Store is filled with mood tracking apps. However, based on my experience, these systems are not particularly effective. One common issue is the lack of distinction between mood and mania level. They assume that an improved mood signifies increasing instability of mania. For example, one system equates a "somewhat elevated mood" with being "more talkative than usual and sometimes experiencing confusion or rapid thoughts." A “very elevated mood" corresponds with "impaired judgment, out-of-character behavior, and reduced need for sleep." According to this system, the elevated mood I experienced when my son was born would be considered unhealthy.

Associating manic symptoms with mood levels disrupts the natural mood continuum. For instance, being “more talkative than usual” doesn't inherently lead to “less need for sleep.” Another mood tracking app asks users to rate their “Today’s most extreme depressed mood” on a scale of None, Mild, Moderate, and Severe. Similarly, it asks for their “Today’s most extreme elevated mood.” Although users can track their responses on a 30-day chart, the results are not particularly revealing.

Another app allows users to rank their mood from 1% to 100%. This establishes a continuum, but it lacks guidance on how to assign these numbers or what exactly they represent. It's unclear why a user would pick 75% over 70%, and there's no guarantee of consistency in their responses.

Numerous mood tracking systems use emojis to symbolize mood, linking emojis to specific events or actions. For instance, a frowning face emoji might be associated with “work.” However, these outcomes are overly general and lack meaningful insight. Some platforms place emojis on a calendar, so January 15th might have a smiley face. Yet, this approach is too vague to be valuable.

# Why This System Works

The mood tracking system I developed, called Tracks, prompts users to answer a series of straightforward yet revealing personal questions (e.g., “Have you been smiling/laughing?”). Responding to these 10 questions is akin to being genuinely asked “how are you?” by someone who sincerely wants to know the answer. The response options are intuitive, and the most suitable answer is always available.

Upon answering these questions, you receive a score on a 100-point scale. An 80 is much better than a 60, just as a 60 is better than a 40, and so on. This scale is logical and highly informative.

In graphic form, you can observe how your mood scores have changed over time. You can quickly pinpoint rough patches and periods of positivity. Additionally, you can precisely understand why those changes occurred, based on notes you leave for yourself. These notes can be minimal (“grocery shopping,” “lunch with dad”) or detailed journal entries. Either way, they offer insights into your circumstances when calculating a particular mood score. You can discern how these events contribute to your broader mood pattern. You'll start to notice patterns, understand the causes of mood fluctuations, and be motivated to engage in more positive activities and fewer negative ones.

The 100-point mood score is applicable to anyone, irrespective of age, gender, location, employment, or relationship status, etc. For individuals with bipolar disorder, however, the system holds even greater power. It can genuinely guide you toward well-being. You can mark on the graph when you began a new antidepressant and analyze the subsequent effects. You can more confidently evaluate whether the medication is effective. If you find yourself admitted to a psychiatric hospital, you can closely examine the events leading up to that point and take measures to prevent recurrence. In essence, Tracks can foster mental wellness for everyone, regardless of whether they have a mental health diagnosis or not.
